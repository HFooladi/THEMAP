   make docs-build
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Code Changes

1. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards

3. **Add tests** for new functionality:
   ```bash
   # Add tests in tests/ directory
   # Run tests to ensure they pass
   python run_tests.py
   ```

4. **Update documentation**:
   ```bash
   # Add docstrings to new functions/classes
   # Update relevant docs in docs/
   # Build docs to check for issues
   make docs-build
   ```

5. **Format and lint code**:
   ```bash
   make format  # Auto-format with ruff
   make lint    # Check for issues
   ```

6. **Commit changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new distance metric for proteins"
   ```

### Commit Message Convention

We follow conventional commit format:

   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Create pull request** on GitHub with:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Link to related issues
   - Screenshots/examples if applicable

3. **Address review feedback**:
   - Respond to comments
   - Make requested changes
   - Update tests/docs as needed

4. **Ensure CI passes**:
   - All tests pass
   - Code coverage maintained
   - Documentation builds successfully

## Code Standards

### Python Style

- **PEP 8** compliance (enforced by ruff)
- **Type hints** for all public functions
- **Docstrings** for all public classes and functions
- **Maximum line length**: 110 characters

### Documentation Style

```python
def compute_distance(
    source_features: List[np.ndarray],
    target_features: List[np.ndarray],
    method: str = "euclidean"
) -> Dict[str, Dict[str, float]]:
    """Compute pairwise distances between feature sets.

    Args:
        source_features: List of feature arrays for source tasks
        target_features: List of feature arrays for target tasks
        method: Distance computation method ("euclidean", "cosine", "otdd")

    Returns:
        Dictionary with target task IDs as keys, containing dictionaries
        with source task IDs as keys and distance values.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If method is not supported
        DistanceComputationError: If computation fails

    Example:
        >>> source_features = [np.array([1, 2, 3])]
        >>> target_features = [np.array([4, 5, 6])]
        >>> distances = compute_distance(source_features, target_features)
        >>> print(distances)
        {'target_0': {'source_0': 5.196}}
    """
```

### Testing Standards

- **Comprehensive coverage**: Aim for >90% test coverage
- **Unit tests**: Test individual functions in isolation
- **Integration tests**: Test component interactions
- **Error handling**: Test exception cases
- **Mocking**: Use mocks for external dependencies

```python
def test_euclidean_distance_success(self, mock_compute_features, sample_tasks):
    """Test successful euclidean distance computation."""
    # Arrange
    mock_compute_features.return_value = sample_features
    distance = MoleculeDatasetDistance(tasks=sample_tasks, method="euclidean")

    # Act
    result = distance.euclidean_distance()

    # Assert
    assert isinstance(result, dict)
    assert "CHEMBL004" in result
    assert isinstance(result["CHEMBL004"]["CHEMBL001"], float)
```

pytest tests/distance/test_tasks_distance_comprehensive.py -v

# Run tests with coverage
python run_tests.py coverage

# Format code
make format

# Check types
mypy themap/

# Build and serve docs
make docs-serve

# Clean all artifacts
make clean
```

```python
# Enable debug logging
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# Use debugger
import pdb; pdb.set_trace()

# Profile performance
import cProfile
cProfile.run('your_function()')
```

### Common Issues
